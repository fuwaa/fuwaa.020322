          Hi! My name is Jariel Que (online alias: tanyu fukazawa). I am
          currently a student in MAPUA University taking the track Bachelor of
          Science in Computer Science since 2021. As far as programming goes, I
          am a self-taught programmer who started from learning Visual Basic
          back in 2016 and went on and off in the programming scene since then.
          In terms of languages, I'd say that C#, Java and Dart are my most
          comfortable ones while the rest is still underway to being
          comfortable. That aside, I am an average gamer ehem. not particularly
          "good" at anything, I enjoy watching anime and jam to JPOP from time
          to time and I'd love to meet people of the same kind or really anyone!
        </p>
